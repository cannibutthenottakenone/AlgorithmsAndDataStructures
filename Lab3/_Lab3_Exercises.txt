First Exercise: Reverse Words

Write a script to reverse each word is a string using a Stack.
Words must stay in the same initial position
E.g., "Algorithm and Data Structures" will become "mhtiroglA dna ataD serutcurtS"




Second Exercise: Delete the middle element of Stack

Write a script to remove the middle element of a Stack
E.g.: input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      output [1, 2, 4, 5]

NOTE: you can solve the problem using an auxiliary stack or using recursion



Third Exercise: Redundant parentheses (DIFFICULT)

Write a function that check whether or not a valid expression has redundant parentheses
E.g.:    ( (a + b) )            # Redundant
         ( a + (b) / c )        # Redundant
         ( a + ( (b + c) ) )    # Redundant
         (a + b * (c - d) )     # Not redundant
